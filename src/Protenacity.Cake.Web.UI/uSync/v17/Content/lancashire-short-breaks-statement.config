Where children have higher or exceptional levels of need a parent carer can request a Children and Family Assessment. This assessment may identify that the child is eligible for Specialist Short Breaks Services as described above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the current time, our new Targeted Break Time offer is still developing, and the hours may not yet be able to meet the needs of all children.

Every child who is eligible for Break Time receives the same number of hours to use to ensure equity.\u003C/p\u003E"
